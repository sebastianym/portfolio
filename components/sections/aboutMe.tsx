          <p>
            I am a Systems Engineering student at the Francisco Jos√© de Caldas
            District University. Since the beginning of my academic career, I
            have discovered a great passion for web development and the world of
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my studies, I have acquired skills in both frontend and
            backend development, which allows me to approach projects
            comprehensively. I am comfortable working with technologies such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React for the
            frontend, as well as Node.js for the backend. Additionally, I have
            experience in managing relational databases, which allows me to
            efficiently design and manage data storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I strive to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies,
            and am always looking to learn and adapt to new tools and
            methodologies. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and am
            committed to continuing to learn and develop in this dynamic field.
            If you have a project in mind or just want to connect, don&apos;t
            hesitate to contact me.
